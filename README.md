## Summary

This is actually several separate C++11/C++14/C++17 libraries:

1. `"date.h"` is a header-only library which builds upon `<chrono>`.  It adds some new `duration` types, and new `time_point` types.  It also adds "field" types such as `year_month_day` which is a struct `{year, month, day}`.  And it provides convenient means to convert between the "field" types and the `time_point` types.

1. `"tz.h"` / `"tz.cpp"`  are a timezone library built on top of the `"date.h"` library.  This timezone library is a complete parser of the IANA timezone database.  It provides for an easy way to access all of the data in this database, using the types from `"date.h"` and `<chrono>`.  The IANA database also includes data on leap seconds, and this library provides utilities to compute with that information as well.

1. `"iso_week.h"` is a header-only library built on top of the `"date.h"` library which implements the ISO week date calendar.

    * Documentation: http://howardhinnant.github.io/date/iso_week.html

1. `"julian.h"` is a header-only library built on top of the `"date.h"` library which implements a proleptic Julian calendar which is fully interoperable with everything above.

    * Documentation: http://howardhinnant.github.io/date/julian.html

1. `"islamic.h"` is a header-only library built on top of the `"date.h"` library which implements a proleptic Islamic calendar which is fully interoperable with everything above.

    * Documentation: http://howardhinnant.github.io/date/islamic.html

## Standardization

`"date.h"` and `"tz.h"` are now being proposed for standardization:

* Current proposal:  http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0355r5.html
* Draft revision:  _not available_
* Status:  The proposal was approved by LEWG and forwarded to LWG with the recommendation of targeting C++20 at the Albuquerque, NM meeting in Nov. 2017.

## Build & Test

You will need [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and a recent C++ compiler. Here follows a guide of how to build and test using the CMake Makefile generator.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
cmake --build . --target testit #Â Consider '-- -j4' for multithreading
```
